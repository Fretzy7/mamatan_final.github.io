        The extension program of NBSC; E-CAI’s: Empowering Community ALS Implementers through Digital Citizenship started last April 6, 2024 until May 24, 2024. As one of the implementers, it is a great opportunity to be part of this training in order to acquire some knowledge about computers and other software applications that would probably be helpful in our teaching career. 
        Spreadsheets. Presentation files. Creating webpage. These are some notable discussions and applications during our training program. I have learned a lot about some formulas that can be used in order to input some data in a spreadsheet faster and easier. There also some ways that would make your presentations more interactive and presentable at the same time. The hardest part of the training is making a webpage. Though it is so satisfying to see your own page but the process on making it is very tiring; in a way that you need to be more careful about small details of your codes and data. But, with the help of our instructors, the activities and exercises are doable and the making of all activities are fun because of our co-CAI’s. The environment is also conducive for training because the equipment is available and our discussion can be directly applied by following the instructions. 
        I am grateful to those people who are behind this program for making this possible. Thankful for prioritizing the ALS in this kind of program knowing that this is part of the learning strand and it can be a way to impart our knowledge to our future learners. Overall, the program created by NBSC is excellent. The school is very accommodating. I am honored to join this kind of training. May God bless you always!
